What are some ideas on how to improve the snow animation as it currently looks?

Uhh... everything.
-Fall not all at the same time.
-More spread out.
-Make it last indefinitely.
-Different snowflakes.
-Different colored snowflakes to simulate weather in dystopian society
-Simulate rising amounts of snow on the ground
