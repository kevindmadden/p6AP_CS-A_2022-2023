<h1>Project #02 - Animate Something</h1>
<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>Create a unique animation that responds in some way both to mouse clicks and mouse hovering.
</p>
<h2>Requirements:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Your animation must react in two different ways. In other words, your animation should not respond in the exact same way to both mouse clicking versus hovering. </li>
    <li>A reaction can be pretty much anything that is visible on the screen. It can be as simple as changing a color.</li>
    <li>Experiment around with what you can do with the toolset you have been given so far. Take your time to figure out how everything works together.</li>
    <li>Your animation should be coded in Java using StdDraw.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Reminder:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>You will need to use if-statements in the animation loop so that certain parts of your code gets run only when certain conditions are met.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Questions?</h2>
Q: Can I have a group of three?
<li>No. Two is the max.</li>

Q: How do I submit as a group?


Q: How do I do something involving mouse clicking? You only showed us how to do stuff involving mouse hovering?
<li>See StdDraw documentation.</li>

Q: How do I generate a random number?
<li>Call <code>Math.random()</code>, which returns a random double value between 0 and 1.</li>
