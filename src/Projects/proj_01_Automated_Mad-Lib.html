    <h1>Project #01 - Automated Mad-Lib</h1>
    <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Write a Mad-Lib. Your program should ask the user to enter words and numbers and then print out the Mad-Lib with the blanks filled in.
    </p>
    <h2>Requirements:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Your Mad-Lib program should have at least 6 blanks.</li>
        <li>At some point, your program must ask the user to fill in an integer value for a blank, a decimal (double) value for a blank, and a word (String) for a blank.</li>
        <li>In your Mad-Lib, there should be at least one point in which a user switches from typing in a word in the previous blank to a number in the current blank.</li>
        <li>Similarly, there should be at least one point in which a user switches from typing in a number to typing in a word.</li>
        <li>You need to write your own original Mad-Lib for this assignment.</li>
        <li>Your program must ask for all of the blanks first and then print out the entire Mad-Lib once the user has typed in the values for all of the blanks.</li>
        <li>Your code should be properly formatted. Indentation should be consistent throughout your code. Variable names should make sense and be clearly named.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Reminder:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>When you call <code>keyboard.nextInt()</code> or <code>keyboard.nextDouble()</code>, this will not move past the hidden linebreak character at the end of a line.</li>
        <li>If you switch from asking for a number to be inputted to asking for a String, then you will need an extra "dummy" call to <code>keyboard.nextLine()</code> to consume the hidden line break character. </li>
    </ul>
